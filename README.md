Polymer in 10 Minutes (Updated)
===============================

These examples were orginally published as "[Polymer in 10 Minutes](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/creatingelements.html)" for Polymer version 0.5. With Polymer 0.8 out, and 1.0 due soon, I decided I could learn best by rewriting them. They track with the 0.5 examples--the output is the same as the orginal examples, though in trying out the new features I may have embellished the code a bit.

As I was finishing these, 0.9 was announced, so I modified the bower.json files and ran them again. They all work.

I've used a demo.html file to load the components vs. index.html. All are designed to be tested with the *polyserve* tool as described by Rob Dobson in [Polycasts #14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Q1mQtFGM8).

Update for 1.0
--------------

I have updated these demos for Polymer 1.0. The biggest change has been to move the `<script>` tags inside the `<dom-module>` as that is [the preferred approach](https://github.com/Polymer/docs/issues/1124).
